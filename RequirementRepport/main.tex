\section{Module's description}
For the moment the questions are created manually by the professor. To increase the number of questions available for a given skill, we want to give the possibility for a professor to create/solve a large sample of questions based on typical problems.\\
And for the students to efficiently train given skills by exercising on a large set of different problems.\\
It means that first the professor has to create a generic question, for example: $ax^2 + bx + c$ for an equation of the second degree. Then from this generic question we will provide an automatic creation of precise question with  multiple values for a, b and c belonging to natural, integer or rational. We also want to provide some control the domain of the question and answer either integer, rational, complex ...\\

We also need to implement a solver for each type of questions.
The solver should be able to give the students the solution and eventually the resolution step by step of the problem. So that the students knows if he provide the correct answer and can understand his mistake if he has done some. When he is training a given skills.\\

For some problems involving geometrical figures, we would like to implement visualization functionnalities for the student.\\
These functionnalities would take the randomized parameters and display the related figures on the student test.\\
For more advanced shapes or 3D shapes, the visualization functionnalities would provide multiple points of view of these shapes, enabling the best understanding of the shape by the student.\\

%For example let's take the case of the calculation of the perimeter of a circle. Our system will create multiple problems concerning

\section{Scenarios}

    \subsection{Assessment for geometry skills}

        \begin{enumerate}

            \item Professor Layton wants to assess his students about basic geometric
            skills.
            \item Layton decides to test his students with perimeter and area
            calculus of triangles (non right-angled).
            \item Layton logs in, reach his class management page and access the
            assessment creation page.
            \item Layton select the skills for area and perimeter calculus of
            non right-angled triangles.
            \item Layton creates the assessment.
            \item Questions have been generated with random values ( not leading
            to extreme shapes of triangle ).
            \item Layton chose to regenerate some of the questions that not
            fit its tastes.
            \item Layton finalize the test creation, his students can now do it online.
        \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Roots of polynomial assessment}

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Professor Oak decides that the time has come to test his students
            on determining the roots of a polynomial.
            \item Oak logs in, reach his class management page and access the
            assessment creation page.
            \item Oak select the said skill in the selection option.
            \item Oak creates the assessment.
            \item Oak is now on the assessment modification page.
            \item Oak chose the type of parameters and answer for the questions
            related to root calculus.
            \item Oak generate a polynomial and an expected answer with those
            parameters
            \item Oak validates the test, students can do the assessment online.
        \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Assessment for students}
    %TODO
    %Split the scenario, one for the Assessment and one for training

        \begin{enumerate}

            \item \hl{Sasha arrives in a Assessment page.}
            \item \hl{Sasha answers at all the exercices given}
            \item \hl{Sasha has finished and leave the assessement.}

            % Only for training, show answers after 3 tries
            %\item Sasha see the correction (not resolution) and read feedback
            %\item Sasha can answers again at the exercice and see again the correction.

        \end{enumerate}

     \subsection{Training for students}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \hl{Student Sasha wants to train her skills in a given subject.}

            \item \hl{Sasha logs in, reach the training section}

            \item \hl{Sasha choose one skills amongst those given by her teacher.}

            \item \hl{Sacha arrives in a Training page.}

            \item \hl{Sasha try to answer the question, after 3 tries the correction is given.}

            \item \hl{Sasha decide she is done training and leave the page.}

\section{Development methodology}

    We will be using SCRUM as the Agile methodology.\\

    SCRUM suits the best our needs for this project for these reasons : \\

        \begin{itemize}
            \item The official planning of the course allows us to organize ourselves
            in multiple sprints, with personal sub-goals to reach the
            official deadline.
            \item Managing a team of eight people might be really difficult using
            Waterfall. With SCRUM, everybody is responsible of his own piece of
            work but also of all the other part of the project.\\
            Nobody's never done with his work and everybody's working towards the
            same goal, which leads to a stronger "team-spirit".
            \item Frequent stand-up meetings are a good source of motivation, a
            useful way to keep everybody's knowledge of the project up-to-date.
            \item The team-leader we elected has already responsibilities about
            communications with the clients and team organization, him being the
            SCRUM-Master won't be an overload of work and will perfectly suits the
            whole organization.

    \end{itemize}

\section{Organisation and distribution of work in the team}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Rémy Voet} : Team-Leader, SCRUM Master
        \item \textbf{Sophie Madessis} : Database Engineer
        \item \textbf{Nicola Romano} : Developer, Test Assistant
        \item \textbf{Youri Mouton} : Lead Developer, Git Master
        \item \textbf{Tristan Moers} : Developer, Team-Leader Assistant
        \item \textbf{Ilias Boutchichi} : Front-End Developer
        \item \textbf{Antoine Rime} : Developer
        \item \textbf{Samuel Monroe} : Behaviour Driven Development, Testing, Front-End Developer
    \end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The course of this first part went well, the scrum methodology is apprehended by everyone. But we encountered difficulties in planning poker our estimates were not close so it took us a long time to discuss. The meeting with the client allowed us to better understand their expectations of the project because it was not well understood. \\

Now with all these points and the client feedback we are ready to start the implementation. We have an idea of what the interface will look like thanks to Wireframes and availables features for user.
